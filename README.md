# youtube-collections
An extension that provides Youtube collections for your subscriptions

## What does it do?

It integrates by modifying the page structure while adhering to YouTube's UI as seamlessly as possible.
It adds an extra list of subscriptions to the left menu and a configuration panel to the subscription management page.

Collections are saved on Google's servers, so it will syncrhonize with other places you use Chrome with the same account.
